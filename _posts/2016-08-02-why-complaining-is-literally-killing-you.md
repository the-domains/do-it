# Why complaining is literally killing you.

By Steven Parton, From 

[CuriousApes.com][0]

Sometimes in life, all the experience and knowledge simmering around in that ol' consciousness of ours combines itself in a way that suddenly causes the cerebral clockwork to click into place, and in this fluid flow of thought we find an epiphany rising to the surface.

One such point for me came in my junior year at University. It changed the way I viewed the world forever as it catapulted me out of the last of my angsty, melancholic youth and onto a path of ever-increasing bliss. Sounds like I'm verging on feeding you some new-agey, mumbo-jumbo, doesn't it? Well, bear with me, because I assure you the point here is to add some logical evidence to the ol' cliches, to give you what I would consider my Science of Happiness.
